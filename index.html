  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What Is a Credit Score?</h2>
    <p>A credit score is a numerical summary of your borrowing behaviour. Lenders use it to estimate how likely you are to repay debts on time. Scores influence which cards you’re eligible for, what limits you receive and whether you qualify for premium benefits.</p>
    <p>Scores change over time based on how you manage existing credit. Even small habits — like letting a statement close with a high balance — can shift your profile up or down.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Score Factors -->
  <section id="factors" class="section">
    <h2>Key Factors That Shape Your Score</h2>
    <p>Most scoring models analyse similar categories. Understanding these helps you predict how actions with your credit cards affect the result.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Payment history:</strong> On-time payments are the single strongest contributor to a healthy score.</li>
      <li><strong>Utilisation ratio:</strong> The percentage of your available credit you’re using — lower is generally better.</li>
      <li><strong>Length of credit history:</strong> Older accounts help stabilise your score; closing long-held cards can reduce this factor.</li>
      <li><strong>New credit:</strong> Applications and hard checks briefly lower your score and signal new liabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit mix:</strong> A variety of credit types — cards, loans, financing — shows you can manage multiple obligations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Card Impact -->
  <section id="impact" class="section">
    <h2>How Credit Cards Directly Influence Your Score</h2>
    <p>Because credit cards are revolving accounts, they impact several score components at once. Your balance at statement time often determines your reported utilisation — even if you pay in full every month.</p>
    <p>Applying for new cards adds a temporary dip from hard checks, while responsible long-term use strengthens your profile by building history and demonstrating consistent repayment behaviour.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Additional Insights -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Common Misconceptions About Credit Scores</h2>
    <p>Many believe carrying a balance improves a score — it doesn’t. Issuers care more about utilisation and payment reliability than interest paid. Similarly, closing unused cards can unintentionally raise utilisation and shorten credit history.</p>
    <p>Scores don’t need to be perfect. Lenders assess overall risk, and strong fundamentals usually outweigh small fluctuations.</p>
